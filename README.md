Wirebind is a reactive data binding library built on top of WebSockets. With Wirebind, your application can interact with state as if it were local and have it seamlessly synchronized across the network.

Wirebind is a language-agnostic protocol built as an extension of CBOR ([RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949)). It is language-agnostic. Currently, libraries exist for Python and JavaScript.
